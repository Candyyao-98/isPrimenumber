A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

# isPrimenumber
This code to check whether the input is prime or not

If the input number is a prime number; then the system will print out x or xx orxxx...  is a prime number

If the input number is not a prime number; then the sytem will print out x or xx or xxx... is not a prime number, please try again.

The time complexity of this code is O(n)
However, if add an while loop (while(true)), to let the code continue running, the time complexity will become O(n^2)

# positionOfPrime
This code is to dermine the position of input prime number

For this part, if the input number is a prime number; then the system will print out x or xx orxxx...  is a prime number, and print out the position of this prime number

If the input number is not a prime number; then the sytem will print out x or xx or xxx... is not a prime number, please try again.

The time complexity of this code is O(N log (log N))
